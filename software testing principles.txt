Software testing principles are guidelines that dictate "where" to focus testing efforts within a software application by identifying high-risk areas, "why" testing is necessary to uncover defects and ensure quality, "when" to start testing early in the development lifecycle, "what" aspects to test based on requirements and user needs, and "how" to design effective test cases by considering factors like defect clustering and the impossibility of exhaustive testing; the key principles include: testing shows the presence of defects, exhaustive testing is impossible, early testing, defect clustering, the pesticide paradox, testing is context-dependent, and the absence-of-errors fallacy. 
Breakdown of the principles:
"What": Testing shows the presence of defects:
The primary goal of software testing is to identify defects or bugs in the software, not to prove its perfect functionality. 
"Why": Exhaustive testing is impossible:
It's impractical to test every possible combination of inputs and conditions, so testers must prioritize high-risk areas based on requirements and user scenarios. 
"When": Early testing:
To catch defects early in the development cycle when they are easier and cheaper to fix, testing should begin as soon as possible. 
"Where": Defect clustering:
A small number of modules or features within the software are likely to contain the majority of defects, so focus testing efforts on these critical areas. 
"How": Pesticide paradox:
Repeatedly running the same set of tests will not find new defects, so test cases need to be regularly updated and revised to cover different scenarios. 
"Context-dependent": Testing is context dependent:
The approach to testing will vary based on the specific software, its target users, and the environment it operates in. 
"Absence-of-errors fallacy":
Finding no defects does not guarantee a high-quality product; testing must also consider usability and user needs.
