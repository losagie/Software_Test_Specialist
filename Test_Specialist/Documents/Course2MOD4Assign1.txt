Feature: CoffeeMakerFeature

In this feature, we are going to test the user stories and use cases for the CoffeeMaker
Example.  We have provided a CoffeeMakerMain.java file that you can use to examine the 
modal behavior in the coffee maker and issue UI commands to use it, so that we can 
adequately test the user stories.

Hints: to catch the mistakes, you might need to add out of range cases for 
recipes and amounts of ingredients.  Also, be sure to check machine state
after running the user story:
  - Are the amounts of ingredients correct?
  - Is the system in the right mode?
  - Is the status what you expect?
  - Is the change produced correct?
  - etc.

Scenario Outline: Waiting State
      Priority: 1 Story Points: 2
      If the Coffee Maker is not in use it waits for user input. There are six different 
      options of user input: 1) add recipe, 2) delete a recipe, 3) edit a recipe, 
      4) add inventory, 5) check inventory, and 6) purchase beverage.
      
      For this scenario, what we will do is try each of the six user inputs and make sure 
      that the coffee maker ends up in the appropriate mode.  This would be a good place
      for a scenario outline with a table that described user inputs and expected final states.
      
      You might also want to try a couple of exceptional values to see what the 
      Coffee Maker does.

      Given THE Coffeemaker is in the waiting mode
      When user press the key <Key>
      Then the status is <Status>
      And the mode is <Mode>
  
      Examples:
     | Key  | Mode               | Status | 
     |  1   |  ADD_RECIPE        |  OK    |
     |  2   |  DELETE_RECIPE     |  OK    |
     |  3   |  EDIT_RECIPE       |  OK    |
     |  4   |  ADD_INVENTORY     |  OK    |
     |  5   |  CHECK_INVENTORY   |  OK    |
     |  6   |  PURCHASE_BEVERAGE |  OK    |
     |  7   | WAITING      |  OUT_OF_RANGE| 
     |  0   | WAITING      |  OUT_OF_RANGE|     



Scenario: Add a Recipe
      Priority: 1 Story Points: 2

      Only three recipes may be added to the CoffeeMaker. A recipe consists of a name, 
      price, units of coffee, units of milk, units of sugar, and units of chocolate. 
      Each recipe name must be unique in the recipe list. Price must be handled as an 
      integer. A status message is printed to specify if the recipe was successfully 
      added or not. Upon completion, the CoffeeMaker is returned to the waiting state.   
      
      For this scenario, you should try to add a recipe to the recipe book, and check to
      see whether the coffee maker returns to the Waiting state.  
      
   Given an empty recipe book  
   When user press the key 1
   	And user provide a valid recipe ingredients
   	And user press enter 
   	Then the status is OK
   	And the mode is WAITING


Scenario Outline: Delete a Recipe
      Priority: 2 Story Points: 1

      A recipe may be deleted from the CoffeeMaker if it exists in the list of recipes in the
      CoffeeMaker. The recipes are listed by their name. Upon completion, a status message is
      printed and the Coffee Maker is returned to the waiting state.  

  Given my basic recipe book 
  When user press the key 2
  And user select a recipe <Recipe> from the list
  Then the status is <Status>
  And the mode is <Mode>
   Examples:
   |Recipe|Status|Mode|
   |0|OK|WAITING|
   |1|OK|WAITING|
   |3|OK|WAITING|
   |4|OK|WAITING|
   |2|OUT_OF_RANGE|WAITING|
   |-2|OUT_OF_RANGE|WAITING|

Scenario: Edit a Recipe
      Priority: 2 Story Points: 1

      A recipe may be edited in the CoffeeMaker if it exists in the list of recipes in the
      CoffeeMaker. The recipes are listed by their name. After selecting a recipe to edit, the user
      will then enter the new recipe information. A recipe name may not be changed. Upon
      completion, a status message is printed and the Coffee Maker is returned to the waiting
      state.  

   Given a default recipe book 
   When user press the key 3
   And user select a recipe 1 from the list
   And user provide a valid recipe ingredients
   And user press enter
   Then the status is OK
   And the mode is WAITING
